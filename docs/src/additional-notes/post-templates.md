# Post Templates

Firma includes the following variations for posts and pages that you can use depending on your needs:

**Table Of Contents**

Provides a table of contents that appears alongside the article, it is useful for long articles that include multiple headings.

**Post without Newsletter**

You can use this template if you do not want to display the Newsletter section at the bottom of an article page.

**Table Of Contents without Newsletter**

I think the name is very clear, it is basically a combination of the two previous templates.

**Page without Newsletter**

You can use this template if you do not want to display the Newsletter section at the bottom of a regular page.

To select any of these templates just open the settings for a post or a page, scroll down and select the one you want in the **Template** section.

The table Of Contents is only available on post pages, not on regular pages.
